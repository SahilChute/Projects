Starting a Scrapy Project
To start a new Scrapy project, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Choose or create a directory where you want to create your Scrapy project.
Run the following command to create a new Scrapy project named my_project (replace my_project with your preferred project name):
Copy code
scrapy startproject my_project
This will create a new directory named my_project containing the basic structure of your Scrapy project.

Running the Spider

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing your Scrapy project (e.g., my_project).
Run the following command:
Copy code
scrapy crawl news_spider -o output_file.json
Replace output_file.json with the desired name for your JSON output file.
